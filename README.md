CocoaSlopes2013
===============

This repository contains example code from my presentations at CocoaSlopes 2013 (http://www.cocoaslopes.com/). This code is simple, and in some cases rough. It's meant to simply demonstrate APIs, programming techniques, etc., rather than as useful, production-ready code.
